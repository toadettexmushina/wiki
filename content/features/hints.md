During the [seed generation](/seedgen), you have the option of enabling different hints through the use of [headers](/seedgen/headers). These are sold by NPCs and provide information on the locations of important skills.

The Zone Hints [header](/seedgen/headers) add hints on Lupoâ€™s map: instead of giving you an item Lupo will tell you how many Key Items are in the current area. Woods and Glades hint are sold by Lupo in Glades. Key Items include every skill, plus Clean Water and Water Breath.

The Teleporter Zone Hints [header](/seedgen/headers) also adds hints on Lupo's map, which will tell you how many Teleporter pickups are in the area. Woods and Glades hint are sold by Lupo in Glades. This header is compatible with the Zone Hints headers. If you activate both, Lupo will give you both the Teleporter and the Zone Hint at the same time.

The Key Hints [header](/seedgen/headers) activates 3 different shop hints, which you can buy at Opher, Twillen and at Lupo in Glades and tell you the zone in which certain important skills are located. Hints decrease in cost by 500 Spirit Light for every skill they contain that you have already found.
* Twilen sells the hint for Bash and Bow, starting at 1500 SL.
* Opher sells the hint for Clean Water, Glide, and Flap instead of selling Water Breath. You will need to complete the Wellspring escape before you are able to purchase it, starting at 2500 SL.
* If you speak to Lupo in his house at Glades he will sell you the hint for Water Dash, Burrow, Grenade, and Flash. This hint starts at a whopping 4000 SL.

After buying these hints, you can press [Alt+P](/features/special-commands) or open your map to display them again.
