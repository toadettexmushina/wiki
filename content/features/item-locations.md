* 14 Spirit Trees (Skill Trees)
* 24 Life Fragments (HC or Health Cell)
* 24 Energy Fragments (EC or Energy Cell)
* 23 Shards
* 38 Gorlek Ore
* 33 Keys (31 Keystones + 2 Eyestones)
* 27 items from shops (including Lupo’s maps)
* 36 items from quests (from both quests’ rewards and items related to quest)
* 148 Spirit Light Containers (EX or experience orbs)
* 5 Shard Slots (from Combat Shrines)
* 5 Wisps (Voice, Memory, Eyes, Strength, Seir)

All pickups are visible on the map from the start of the game. Additionally, an In-Logic filter has been added to the map so you can quickly tell which items the logic expects that you can reach given your current selected [paths](/seedgen/paths), skillset, and resources.
